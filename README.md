# Repository contents

- [data.csv](data.csv) Contains long format data. Columns are:
  - `experiment`: `1` or `2` for the first or second replicate.
  - `virus`: `BVic`, `BYam`, `H1N1`, `H3N2` or `SARS-CoV-2`
  - `pre_sample`: This individual's pre-vaccination sample*.
  - `post_sample`: This individual's post-vaccination sample name*.
  - `log_pre_titer`: Pre-vaccination titer on the log scale.
  - `log_post_titer`: Post-vaccination titer on the log scale.
  - `log_delta_titer`: `log_post_titer` minus `log_delta_titer`
  - `sites`: `Ipsilateral` or `Contralateral` indicating whether this individual received
    their flu and COVID vaccines ipsilaterally or contralaterally.
- [analysis.ipynb](analysis.ipynb) is an IPython notebook containing code to rerun the
  Bayesian model used in the study, and to recreate [Figure 1](fig1.pdf) (the legend and
  tick labels were manually edited for the manuscript version.)
- [effects.csv](effects.csv) is generated by the IPython and contains summaries of
  posterior distributions of model effects.
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) contains python package versions used in this
  analysis. Install them (in a new virtual environment) via `pip install -r
  requirements.txt`
